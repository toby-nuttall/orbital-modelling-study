# orbital-modelling-study
In this project I studied orbital modelling with FuncAnimations, building various orbits like hohmann trasnfers and rendezvous <br>
first I built a 2D rendezvous orbit with 2 bodies, mostly to get to grips with numerically solving DE's (I tried a few differnet methods, settling on the leapfrog method) <br>
next I built a 3D orbit model, "working_example.py", It was much harder to do and the approach required completely changed, furthermore the complexity increased greatly <br>
then I built a hohmann transfer orbit in 3D "hohmann transfer.py", finally I showcased how the model could handle multiple bodies at once "final.py"<br>
in the future I would be interested to try: <br>
embeding this in a GUI somehow <br>
modelling a gravitational slingshot<br>
modelling the solar system <br>
modelling the voyager path through the solar system<br>
modelling the three body problem, with interactive initial condition sliders to explore the different cases
